Check if a singly linked list has a loop.

Checking was performed using Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also called the "tortoise and the hare" algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at different speeds.

I implemented the linked list abstract data type.

I created test for both, the LinkedList and the algorithm.
